talking structured like program code

The current nested pure structured documentation tools is <a href="https://witheve.com">eve language</a> and the title of <a href="https://roamresearch.com">roam research</a>. <a href="http://www.rebol.com">rebol</a> is a great looking programming language. It eliminates a lot of symbols. So I was inspired by robol to make improvements.

Currently I translate the rebol form of the language into the eve form. This allows structured queries to be made with eve.

## Operation is as follows

1. open file <a href="https://tomzcn.github.io/talking-structured-like-program-code/toeve.html">"toeve.html"</a> in browser.

2. click "r2e".

3. copy the "out".

4. open <a href="https://btheado.github.io/tweve/">tweve</a> in browser.

5. click "+".

6. named "1.eve"

7. paste to the text. and type some text to the front of it. like this.

<pre>
```eve
search
  o1 = [#o1]
  [#the object: d1]
bind
  o1.text := " {{d1}} "
```

```eve
commit
  [#html/element tagname: "div" #o1  text: "1"]
```

```eve
commit
[#be subject:[#of thing:[#the object:"capital"] limit:"china"] judgment:"beijing"]
```
</pre>

8. click "✓"

9.  click "+".

10. named "1.eve.exe"

11. type some thing like this.

<pre>
<$eve markdown={{1.eve}}/>
</pre>

12. click "✓"

13. This way you can see the query results in 1.eve.exe

## Syntax

$ means this is a function name.

The number after $ is the priority.
